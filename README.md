# Gucci

Gucci is a Ruby library for searching, downloading and parsing lobbying and contribution filings from the Clerk of the House of Representatives.

Gucci::House::Search is a wrapper around the lobbying and contribution search forms on the Clerk's website (http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/ldsearch.aspx and http://disclosures.house.gov/lc/lcsearch.aspx).

Gucci::House::Filing creates an object corresponding to an electronic filing from the Clerk, either a lobbying registration (LD1), a lobbying report (LD2) or a contribution disclosure (LD203).

Gucci is named after a book about lobbying, if you're wondering. It's a perfectly cromulent name.

## Installation

Searching with Gucci uses Selenium and Firefox for headless browsing and is limited to platforms that support Xvfb, including Ubuntu and OSX using Macports only, not Homebrew. Changing that is on the list of tasks for the project.

Otherwise, the software is functional, though still in development.

Gucci was mostly developed on Ubuntu 12.04 using Ruby 2.1.1, but will work on Ruby versions 1.9.2 and later. If installing on Ubuntu server, Gucci needs Firefox to run. Gucci has received limited testing on OS 10.9 and has not been tested on Windows.

To install on Ubuntu 12.04 or greater:

    sudo apt-get install xvfb

    export DISPLAY=:99 # add this to your environment so that xvfb won't conflict with any other displays

    git clone the repository

    bundle install

## Usage

### Examples

    require 'gucci'

I. Searching

A. Lobbying disclosures

Perform a search for form LD1 or LD2 filings (lobbying registrations and lobbying activity reports) submitted for Lockheed Martin in 2013:

    search = Gucci::House::Search.new(:client_name => "Lockheed Martin", :filing_year => 2013)

B. Contribution disclosures

Perform a search for form LD203 filings submitted by Lockheed Martin and its individual lobbyists in 2013:

    search = Gucci::House::Search.new(:organization_name => "Lockheed Martin", :filing_year => 2013, :contributions => true)

The search is performed when `Gucci::House::Search.new` is called. You can then access the results of the search with `search.results`, an array of search result objects:

    results = search.results
    results.size
    => 100

Each result object has the following attributes:

For lobbying filings:
- filing_id
- registrant_id
- registrant_name
- client_name
- filing_year
- filing_period
- lobbyists

For contribution filings:
- filing_id
- house_id
- organization_name
- remaining_items

Create a `Gucci::House::Filing` object from one of the results and download the filing data:

    filing = Gucci::House::Filing.new(results.first.filing_id).download
