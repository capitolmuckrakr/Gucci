# Gucci

Gucci provides a way to search, download and parse lobbying and lobbyist contribution filings from the Clerk of the House of Representatives.

Gucci::House::Search is a Ruby wrapper around the lobbying and contribution search forms on the Clerk's website (http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/ldsearch.aspx and http://disclosures.house.gov/lc/lcsearch.aspx).

## Usage

### Example

    require 'gucci'

Perform a search for form LD1 and LD2 filings (lobbying registrations and lobbying activity reports) submitted for Lockheed Martin in 2013:

    search = Gucci::House::Search.new(:client_name => "Lockheed Martin", :filing_year => "2013")

The search is performed when `Gucci::House::Search.new` is called. You can then access the results of the search with `search.results`, which is simply an array of search result objects:

    results = search.results
    results.size
    => 100

Each `Fech::SearchResult` object has the following attributes:

- amended_by
- committee_id
- committee_name
- date_filed
- date_format
- description
- filing_id
- form_type
- period

You can now work with the results as you would any Ruby array.

Remove any filings that have been amended:

    results.select! { |r| r.amended_by.nil? }
    results.size
    => 41

Limit to filings covering the last six months of 2012:

    results.select! { |r| r.period[:from] >= Date.new(2012, 7, 1) && r.period[:to] <= Date.new(2012, 12, 31) }
    results.size
    => 6

Create a `Fech::Filing` object from one of the results and download the filing data:

    filing = results.first.filing.download

You now have access to the same filing object and methods as if you had created it directly with [Fech](http://nytimes.github.io/Fech/).

To initialize the `Fech::Filing` object with parameters, pass them as arguments to the `SearchResult#filing` method:

    filing = results.first.filing(:csv_parser => Fech::CsvDoctor)

Get information from the filing:

    filing.summary[:col_a_total_receipts]
    => "4747984.49"

    filing.summary[:col_b_total_receipts]
    => "10617838.18"

### Search parameters

The following search parameters are available:

- `:committee_id` (The nine-character committee ID assigned by the FEC)
    - examples: "C00499202", "C00130187"
- `:committee_name`
    - examples: "Restore Our Future", "Obama for America"
- `:state` (Two-character state abbreviation)
    - examples: "MA", "FL"
- `:party` (Three-character party abbreviation)
    - examples: "REP", "DEM"
- `:committee_type` (One-character committee type. [See a list of committee types](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/CommitteeTypeCodes.shtml))
    - examples: "H", "P"
- `:report_type` ([See a list of report types](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/ReportTypeCodes.shtml))
    - examples: "M4", "Q1"
- `:date` (A Ruby Date object)
- `:form_type` ([See the FEC's electronic filing search for a list of form types](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/efile_search.shtml))
    - examples: "F3", "F24"
  
Any number of these parameters may be used. However, the FEC's search functionality has some limitations:

- All other parameters are ignored when `:committee_id` is used.
- `:form_type` cannot be used by itself; another parameter must be used with it.

An `ArgumentError` will be raised if either of these is violated with `Fech::Search.new`.

__Note:__ Overly broad searches can be slow, so you should make your search as specific as possible.
